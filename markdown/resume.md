Harry Staley is a life-long learner with a love for data and the democratization of information that has come to the world with the advent of the Internet.  His passion for technology began in 2004 with the development of a database project during a summer internship while working on his first Bachelor’s Degree.  Since that time, he has grown that passion for technology and for how data fuels the engine of modern innovations such as IDS, voice assistants, and autonomous vehicles.  Through his journey he has engaged in self-directed learning using tools like MIT Open Courseware, Khan Academy, and Coursera to grow his toolkit of skills and knowledge, and now gives back to others by teaching Python and Cyber Security through Udacity and ThriveDX.  As part of Harry’s vision for the democratization of information online, he engages in community volunteer efforts working on open source software, working with organizations like Code Alliance and Techtonica, and mentoring students. For the last 12 years, Harry has applied his skills in data science and data engineering to serve the public through advancing the efficiency of US Army & DoD procurement systems.

Experience
----------

**Data Team Lead:**

Utilized knowledge of Army procurement systems such as  VCE to develop data analytics and procurement decision support products leveraging Army and DoD business intelligence and data pipelining platforms such as VCE-BI,  Army Vantage, and other tools and techniques.

Routinely delivered ad-hoc and recurring reports supporting senior leadership (SPE, HCAs, AAE, PDEP) and external organizations alike (DOJ, OSD, DUSA, GAO), including automation of report delivery for recurring requirements.

Provide expertise in planning and conducting critical projects vital to the enhancement of procurement analytics. Some examples are the development of systems interfaces between data warehouses and analytics platforms, the development of new analytics/reporting capabilities, and selecting the proper analytics tool given stakeholder requirements.

* As the interim team lead for the Data Team, I constructed a team charter supporting our mission across the Army Contracting Enterprise, aligning the team charter with Army Contracting Enterprise Lines of Effort.
* Developed relationships championing new tools, techniques, and processes to streamline the analytics process, improve data quality, and enhance our analytics capabilities.
* Collaborated with other senior Data Scientists to develop an enterprise solution to track acquisitions in support of the conflict in Ukraine before the addition of a National Interest Action (NIA) code.
* Collaborated with General Officer/SES level leaders across the ACE to solve data acquisition challenges.
* Developed and delivered Contour 101 (Army Vantage) training to members of FORSCOM, ACC, and DASA(P).
* Developed a cross-functional architectural diagram documenting the data pipeline from the point of collection to data warehousing and arrival at analytics platforms.
* Planned and developed data pipelines using Python (PySpark) to pre-process and clean Department of the Army level data.
* Refactored existing pipeline processes utilizing computationally efficient algorithms to ensure performance within acceptable standards.
* Developed a Python program to capture and parse text from Defense.gov to turn unstructured text capturing acquisition data in support of category management efforts.
* Utilized Army Vantage and PySpark to create data visualizations for tactical and strategic leader consumption.
* Worked with data owners to facilitate the ingestion of new data sources into Palantir Foundry a.k.a. Army Vantage.
* Acted as the technical POC on several other projects developing/procuring software solutions and solving business problems such as Streamlining Acquisition Requirements, Market Research and Proposal Ingestion, Category Management spend plan Data Pipeline, Product Service Code Clustering, Contractor Digital Signatures on Contracting Documents.
* Championed Agile methodologies as a best practice to foster a culture of continuous delivery to achieve optimal results.
* Mentor and collaborate with other Data Scientists, Data Engineers, and Data Analysts across the Army footprint to drive knowledge sharing and up-skilling/re-skilling efforts, conducting monthly technical workshops and developed pathways for budding technologists to discover new skills and abilities through the Data Science and Data Analytics communities of interest.
* Invited to attend and contribute to the executive steering session and weekly production meetings for Business Health Metrics by the Office of Business Transformation. 

**Lead Instructor - Cyber Security and Software Development**

Act as a Lead Instructor for Cyber Security and Software Development and act as a point of contact with the operations team.
Teach Cyber and Network Security with a focus on preparing students to build the skills and knowledge base to take and pass certification exams such as the CompTIA Network+, CompTIA Security +, and CEH. Teach Software Development focusing students on learning and applying Agile methodologies while developing Full Stack software solutions that meet or exceed technical and user experience requirements.

* Teach in a highly interactive and engaging style, analyze and synthesize complex technical information and present it simply and clearly.
* Responsible for classroom management and pedagogy, scaffolded learning, and checks for understanding and knowledge.
* Lead Lab Activities.
* Field questions and assist students on Zoom/Slack/Canvas.


Technical Experience
--------------------

My Cool Side Project
:   For items which don't have a clear time ordering, a definition
    list can be used to have named items.

    * These items can also contain lists, but you need to mind the
      indentation levels in the markdown source.
    * Second item.

Open Source
:   List open source contributions here, perhaps placing emphasis on
    the project names, for example the **Linux Kernel**, where you
    implemented multithreading over a long weekend, or **node.js**
    (with [link](http://nodejs.org)) which was actually totally
    your idea...

Programming Languages
:   **Python 3:** Here, we have an itemization, where we only want
    to add descriptions to the first few items, but still want to
    mention some others together at the end. A format that works well
    here is a description list where the first few items have their
    first word emphasized, and the last item contains the final few
    emphasized terms. Notice the reasonably nice page break in the pdf
    version, which wouldn't happen if we generated the pdf via html.

:   **second-lang:** Description of your experience with second-lang,
    perhaps again including a [link] [ref], this time placing the url
    reference elsewhere in the document to reduce clutter (see source
    file). 

:   Basic knowledge of **C**, **Java**, **forth**, **Common Lisp**

Extra Section, Call it Whatever You Want
----------------------------------------

* Human Languages:

     * English (native speaker)
     * ???
     * This is what a nested list looks like.

* Random tidbit

* Other sort of impressive-sounding thing you did
